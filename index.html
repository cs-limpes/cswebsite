                  <h1>Hi, I'm Charlene</h1>
                  <h2>Technology and Marketing Consultant</h2>
                  <p>I have two decades of experience in software engineering, architecture, and application development.<br />
                  I specialize in custom website and software development, digital marketing, and accessibility consulting.</p>
            </div>

      <section class="intro">
            <div>
                  <h2>About Me</h2>
                  <p>I began my journey building computers, setting up networks, and writing desktop applications.</p>

                  <p>Then I fell in love with the internet - teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

                  <p>When I moved from desktop application development to web development, it was typical and normal for one person to handle everything on a website - from coding to design to security to marketing. I've always been a generalist and I've always loved learning new things, so I was in my element.</p>

                  <p>Over the years, these areas became specializations and they are a lot to keep up on - and naturally, I've had to let some things go. But I've held on to engineering, usability/user experience, and marketing.</p>
                        
                  <p>Since I worked with so many small businesses and independent artists, I found myself doing a lot of business consulting as well - helping them create pricing structures and packages, hiring their teams, teaching them about payroll practices, etc. And slowly began to offer my own consultation services - and naturally, the businesses I worked with became larger, too, and I grew with them.</p>

                  <p>I primarily provide technology solutions and marketing consultations - software development, architecture, and IT strategy, as well as content strategy, assessments, SEO, growth strategy, and go-to-market strategies. </p>

                  <p>I truly believe that technology is a tool that can make lives better, easier, and more productive - taking humanity to places we only ever dreamed of - and I'm extremely excited about and proud of my contributions to that development.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Three things I stand behind:</h2>
            <div class="threethings">
                  <p class="thing">I'm passionate about user experience and believe strongly in listening to the people using your product - external and internal. They know best how a product is being used rather than how it was intended to be used and it's essential to listen to their feedback and requests.</p>
                  <p class="thing">A truly intuitive user interface has yet to be developed - we have all been taught to use websites and applications and because they all use similar interfaces, they "feel" intuitive - but they aren't.</p>
                  <p class="thing">Accessibility is essential and the curb cut effect is real. If you ignore disabled and otherwise impaired users, your product will suffer and you will be left behind - this user group needs to be top of your list instead of an after thought.</p>
